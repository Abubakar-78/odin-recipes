        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A great homemade pizza starts with a soft, stretchy dough made from flour, warm water, yeast, olive oil, and a pinch of salt, left to rise until airy. Once rolled out, the dough is topped with a layer of rich tomato sauce seasoned with garlic, oregano, and basil. Fresh mozzarella is scattered generously over the surface, followed by toppings like pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, olives, or whatever you enjoy most. A drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of parmesan finish it off before baking at high heat until the crust turns golden and crisp and the cheese melts into bubbling perfection. Served hot, it’s simple, customizable, and incredibly satisfying.
