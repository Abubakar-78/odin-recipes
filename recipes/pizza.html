        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A great homemade pizza starts with a soft, stretchy dough made from flour, warm water, yeast, olive oil, and a pinch of salt, left to rise until airy. Once rolled out, the dough is topped with a layer of rich tomato sauce seasoned with garlic, oregano, and basil. Fresh mozzarella is scattered generously over the surface, followed by toppings like pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, olives, or whatever you enjoy most. A drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of parmesan finish it off before baking at high heat until the crust turns golden and crisp and the cheese melts into bubbling perfection. Served hot, it’s simple, customizable, and incredibly satisfying.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            Mix flour, yeast, salt, olive oil, and warm water to form a dough, knead it until smooth, and let it rise for about an hour. Roll out the dough into a circle or rectangle, spread tomato sauce over it, sprinkle minced garlic and oregano, then add shredded mozzarella cheese. Add any other toppings you like, and bake in a preheated oven at 220°C (425°F) for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
